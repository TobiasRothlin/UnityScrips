# UnityScrips

This is a small collection of usefull scrips for Unity. The scrips can be usd freely and I am very happy for feedback. 
All this Scrips can be used by cloning this directory into the Assets folder of your Unity Project. Then simply draging the Script onto the gameObject you want to apply it to. 

## Folder Cam
In this folder there are two scrips to apply to a camera object. 

### LinkDollyToObject.cs
```
target        -> is a gameObject to which the camera will be linked
smoothness    -> is how smooth the camera will follow the target
```
This script lets the Camera follow the target Object with a constant offet. This offset is set by placeing the camera in a certain distanz away from the targt.
The movement simulates a dolly move.
